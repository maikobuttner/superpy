This project has mostly been challenging for me because of the logic within the main.py file, containing the parsers. Therefore I would highlight this as one of the technically noticeable achievements. To find a way and creating parsers in the right order and pass through information to the functions is my pride in this application. 

Creating functions that read and/or write CSV files was also difficult for me but with finding out about the pandas library helped me a lot. Therefore I think using a combination of pandas and the regular csv module for writing is another one of the technically noticeable achievements.

The third technical achievement I think is noticeable, is the fact that the program can travel in the future and utilize this in other functions (for example to check whether products are expired).

Overall I am happy to deliver a working superpy application. And I hope this is sufficient to complete the course and start using Python in data issues that I come accross with my job.
