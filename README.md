# superpy

Superpy is a Command Line Interface for a supermarket that registers information about bought products, sold products, whether products are expired today as well as in the future. The CLI also returns reports about the current stock, expiration dates and general information about products.

This repository contains a number of files, two of those files are Python files. Those python files are main.py and functions.py. In the main.py you will find parsers for the CLI that pass through values to the functions. And as the filename states, functions.py contains the functions that do all of the above.

Have fun using it! 

P.s. this is a project for Winc Academy.
